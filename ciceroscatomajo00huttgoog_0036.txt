the book is addressed‚ Titus Atticus. Not the least ol
the merite ol M. Boissier's hooh--the most suggestive
book on Cicero-is thet it makes Atticus interesting.

been a dissembling knave and the most perfect vicar ol
Bray extant.'' Lord Bolingbroke surprises us—for we
are hardly accustomed to regard his Lortlship as the dc-
fender ot public morale-by asimilar verdicw: “Atticus
whose great talents were usury and trirnn1i11g‚ who placed

it is untrne-for it is not- -butthet it is only half the truth.
Atticus must have been more than a usuror and trimmer,
