No work more snitable than “Cato Maj0r” could haro
boen selected bytho Unircrsity authorities as the proso
Δ Latin of J unior Matricnlntion. Cicero’s political philosophy
and speculative philosophy aro difficult; bnt in his moral
tremisce-especially in the little cssnys on Old Ago and
Friendsliip‚-his style is rcry simple. Sernetimcs harnes aro
bughears, and the name “philosophy'’ has frighteued array
many a student irem sorno of tho richcst treats in all
literature.

The rrrain topic ol tho socalled Dialogus on Old Age is
peculiarly attractiva, cren to tho youthlul student. As ho
is led on, step by step, through t'nc artless arguments-
arguments not of the head, but ol tho hcart-he becomes
more and more attached to the old man who speaks through
the lips of Cato. Tho last chapters, containing Cicero’s
rierrs regarding the immortality ol the soul, are most on·
chanting. As the pagan philosopher reaches the last round
ol his elimax, aud grapplcs with the grandcst problem that
can engago the attention ol marn—as he “stretehes out his
lame hands of laith'’ and almost grasps the truths of Revo-
lation,—as his airy rision fills him withmomentary rapturo,
-the earnest strnlent is carried away with him into regions
lar above the petty eoneerns and tho mechania philosophies
ol this “working-day world.'¹

It is necessary to notice some of the special features of tho

present edition ol tho ‘⁶ Cat0.’' Tho desire ol tho editor to
make the work as ralnable as possible has led him to depnrt
in several respects from the beaten path.

The Introduction by Prol. Hulton will bs highly prlnsdbp

all the lrr'emb of classical literature ln this aruntis.
