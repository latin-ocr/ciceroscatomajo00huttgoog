m, tenantur OF m CATO·

It hasbeen assumed by many that Cicero in the “De Senec-
tute” affected the entique style oi Ceto. This noticn must be
dispelled. We have it is true some horridiora verba ln the treat-
iss, but on the whole the Latin is Ciceronisn, und the style is as
iar removed trum that oi De re rustica us it well could be. 'Phe
alleged archaisms are (1) the passive use oi deponent participles,
es adeptam, dimensa, meditatum, in sections 4, 59, 743 (2) the
use ot the nom. oi the gerund governing en ecc. in sect. 6,-
quarn inprcdiendum sit ; 3) the occurrence oi neutiquam in sec.
423 (4) the occurrence oi qrrasi ior quemadmodum in sect. 713 (5) Χ
ihc use oi audaciter ior audacter in sect 723 (6) end oi tuerentur
ior intuerentur in sect. 77.
