book in this light is evident not only from the date ol its
composition, but froin the tone in which he speaks ol it
in his letters. “I rnust read my ‘Cato Major’ oltener:

again, “I arn glad 111yCuto does you good.''¹⁵² Even to
Cicero—lightly though he took philosophy—his treatise'
was more u seruiou than an essay. But niore than this :
to a Roman whose national literature was still young—et
any rate so far as philosophy wus concerned-the work
would not seem hackneyed. We may conclude thiu re-
view ol “De Senectute’⁷ by quoting-again from Words-
worth—-some stannes parallel in spirit though fer more
exquisite in expression to u pussuge⁶³ of thiuboolr ε
My eyes ere dim with childish teers,
My heert'is idly utirred, ,

For the seme souud is iu my euro
Which in those duys 1 heerd.

Thus lares it still in our decey:
And yet the wiser mind

Monrns less ior what ege takes away
Thon what it leaves behind.

The hlaekbird iu tho summer trees,
The lerk upon the hill,

Iret loose their cerole when they phase,
Are quiet when they will,

With nature never do they wege
A loolieh strile: they soe

A happy youth, und their old ugo
Is bcuutilul and free.
