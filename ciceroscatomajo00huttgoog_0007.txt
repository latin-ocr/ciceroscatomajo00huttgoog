The Examination Pepere—the contributione 01 twenty-four
masters-supply data ior forming an accurate estimato 01 the
collective opinion 01 the Classical Masters 01 the Provinoe
regarding the proper scope and character 01 0 matriculation
paper in Latin. The editor takes thie opportunity to thank
his friends 101 their genereus aid in the accomplishment 01
his design.

Anold text hae been reproduoed in thie edition 101 various

reasons. The public examinare still see fit to eet belore can·
didates selectione from the old texts 01 classical authors.
vltlany 01 our classical masters hesitate to diecard the ortho-
graphy 01 Latin words with which they became familiar in
their· boyhood. Oanadian classical editors bave hitherto
clung to the old 1011110. Exanriners and masters and editors
all admit that the scienca 01 philology has advanced with
long strides during the last twenty years. Every one knows
that coelum, coena, 0001011, are baselese fictione3 yet the anti-
qnated forme are still in vogue. In the 11010001 thie edition
the attention 01 the‘etudent has been called to many time-
honored blunders.
Ι 111 the matter 01 etymology, too, we nave stagnated long
enough. In the present editor’s edition 01 Virgil's AEneid‚
Book V.‚ it was thought expedient to give many 01 the old
' derIvatione. In this edition 01 “Cata'’ the obsoleta assump-
tione 01 theold grammariane have been entirely abandoned,
and the more rational explanatione 01 modern philologiste
have been adopted. Harper'e Latin Dictiona1·y(Andrews’s
Freund) hae been lollowed in almost every case. This lexicon
will probably within ten years he the standard authority on
Latin orthography and etymology wherever the English lan·
guage ie spoken.

In the notes, the editor has collated from many sources

everything that would tend to elucidata the text. His ob·
ligatione to the different authorities consulted have been

acknowledged throughout the notes.
