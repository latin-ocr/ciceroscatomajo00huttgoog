Futurum cst· 'I'his periphrasis for erit represents the event
as on the very verge ot tulfihnent.
Mel molestum est· A courteous expression like our “ 11 you
pleasol‘, ’
mquam lencm aliquam vium. Notice the terminatione,
representing perhaps the tedicusness of a long journey.

inqreda‘endum rit governing quam. It seems like an imitation

of the Greek construction with the vcrbal in-reor. It is a rare

would be perae notia inqrediendc.

Istuc· Neut. acc. of pronoun istic, istaec, istoc or istac,
emphatic form of what is called the demonstrative of the second

ὁμοῖον ὁμοίῳ ἀεὶ πελάζει, Symp. O. 18, 3; and in many other Greek
writers. We have it in English in ¹‘ Birds ol a teather flock to-
gethe1·¹' and “ Like will 1ο likc.'’ Compare Ecelua 13, 15,
“Every beast loveth his kind and every man loveth his neigh-
bour: all flesh consortoth according 1ο kind and a man will cleave
to his like.’' Facillime : ‘most cheerlully)
